# Skin pQTL Study

This repository contains analysis scripts for the **skin protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL)** study.  
The project integrates skin proteomics, genetics, and transcriptomics to uncover molecular mechanisms underlying leprosy susceptibility and skin immune regulation.

---

##  Overview

The scripts in this repository cover the complete analysis workflow:

1. **Proteome processing and QC**
2. **Age-associated proteome analysis**
3. **pQTL discovery and fine-mapping**
4. **QTL post-processing and annotation**
5. **Transcriptome-wide and proteome-wide association analyses (TWAS/PWAS)**
6. **Integration with disease GWAS (e.g., leprosy)**
