# skin_pQTL Analysis

This repository contains the code and essential data used for the analysis in the skin pQTL study.  
The project includes R scripts, shell workflows, and  datasets.  

---

##  Overview

The scripts in this repository cover the complete analysis workflow:

1. **Proteome processing and QC**
2. **Age-associated proteome analysis**
3. **pQTL discovery and fine-mapping**
4. **QTL post-processing and annotation**
5. **Transcriptome-wide and proteome-wide association analyses (TWAS/PWAS)**
6. **Integration with disease GWAS (e.g., leprosy)**


---

## Data Availability

The `data/` folder contains **essentail files** to illustrate input formats required to reproduce all results  .  
** Some full datasets are not completely included** due to size constraints (>50–100 MB).


To fully reproduce the results, please download or generate the required data.

Links for downloading full data or instructions to generate them may be provided in R or shell scripts.

## Usage

### 1. Running the R scripts
Navigate to the `R/` folder.  
Scripts are named following the analysis workflow (e.g., preprocessing → pQTL mapping → integration → visualization).

Example:
```bash
Rscript 01_proteome_processing.R
Rscript 04_QTL_process.R

2. Running the shell scripts

Shell scripts in shell/ folder are used for:

batch processing

submitting jobs to HPC clusters

running QTL tools

Example:

bash 03_pQTL_formal_code.sh

Ensure required software and environment modules are installed.
